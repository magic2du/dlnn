DLNN
====

DLNN is a lightweight, easy-to-use deep learning toolkit developed under the [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano) environment. 

Factories and new network models has been added. In the fatories, we support arbitury combinations of network settings, like dropout, sparsity, denoising, contraction, momentum, L1 and L2. The API is simple to use. Stacked parallel auto encoders, and Stacked target-aware auto encoders are supported.

This is an extention to PDNN (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ymiao/pdnntk.html). Special Thanks to PDNN.
factories -- the factories generate different models, include parallel auto encoders,
cmds     -- commands to conduct general-purpose deep learning  
cmds2    -- additional commands specifically for ASR  
examples -- example setups  
io_func  -- data reading functions; model IO functions; model format conversion  
layers   -- layers: convolution, fully-connected, denoising autoencoder, logistic regression, etc  
learning -- learning algorithms  
models   -- models: CNNs, DNNs, SDAs, SRBMs, etc  
utils    -- utility functions: learning rates, argument parsing, etc
